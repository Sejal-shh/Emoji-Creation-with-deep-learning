In this project, I have built a convolution neural network architecture and train the model on FER2013 dataset for Emotion recognition from images

Category: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, AI

Programming Language: Python

Tools & Libraries: OpenCV haarcascade

# About the Dataset
The FER2013 dataset ( facial expression recognition) consists of 48*48 pixel grayscale face images. The images are centered and occupy an equal amount of space. This dataset consist of facial emotions of following categories:

0: angry <br>
1: disgust<br>
2: feat<br>
3: happy<br>
